# swingFixxer
Some tools to fix the very old game SWING from Software2000, made in 1996.

The folder "RegistryFix" contains a .cpp file usable to fix the missing registry keys. If you have Windows 10, you need this to get the old keys back.

Thanks to @Jusonex: for the help with the injection thingy :)
We are currently working to get the game running in windowed mode.
